# IoT-Based-Smart-Billboard
This project is an IoT-enabled Smart Billboard that dynamically plays advertisements based on real-time environmental conditions. It uses Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and multiple sensors (DHT11 for temperature/humidity, PIR for motion detection, and KY-038 for sound levels) to optimize ad selection and playback.
